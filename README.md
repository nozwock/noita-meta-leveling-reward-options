An addon for [Meta Leveling](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3338209310) which allows for configuring reward parameters.

Setting a reward’s probability to 100% doesn’t guarantee it will drop. Rewards use a card deck system, where each percentage adds a card for that reward into the deck. A set number of cards are then randomly drawn from this deck as the rewards shown to the player. Additionally, some rewards require specific conditions, beyond probability, to become available.
